    <p>
      Born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico. passionate about geek - tech - arts - cultural things but also in making things done.<br>
      Most of my time in university I was involved with non profit organizations and volunteer programs creating solutions for my city and school
      participating and creating events, workshops, meetups and more. Really interested in closing the gap between technology, school and community in Mexico. 
      I think there's still a lot to do and I'm trying my best to solve it.<br>
      Constantly in hackathons as coach, mentor and/or participating. Won a few awards and swag, but the most valuable thing was meeting a lot of creative and
      talented people.<br>
      Right now I'm focusing in a Machine Learning career.
